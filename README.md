# PHP Beginners Class DevContainer

This repository serves as a development container (DevContainer) to PHP for beginners class provided by [Laracats](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners-2023-edition), based on the [vscode-remote-try-php](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amicrosoft+vscode-remote-try-php&type=Repositories) sample project. I used this setup as a sandbox environment during my PHP beginners class to practice and experiment with PHP concepts.

A **development container** is a running container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** or **[Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

## Features

- **Ready-to-Use DevContainer:** The repository provides a pre-configured DevContainer setup, allowing you to start coding immediately without worrying about environment configuration.

- **PHP Playground:** Use this repository as your personal PHP playground. Experiment with PHP code, test concepts, and explore new ideas in a controlled and isolated environment.
